Selenium is an ==umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries== that enable and support the ==automation of web browsers==.

It provides extensions to ==emulate user interaction with browsers==, a distribution server for scaling browser allocation, and the infrastructure for implementations of the [W3C WebDriver specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) that ==lets you write interchangeable code for all major web browsers==.

This project is made possible by volunteer contributors who have put in thousands of hours of their own time, and made the source code [freely available](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/about/copyright/#license) for anyone to use, enjoy, and improve.

Selenium brings together browser vendors, engineers, and enthusiasts to further an open discussion around automation of the web platform. The project ==organises [an annual conference](https://www.selenium.dev/)== to teach and nurture the community.

At the core of Selenium is [WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/), an interface to write instruction sets that can be run interchangeably in many browsers. Once you’ve installed everything, only a few lines of code get you inside a browser. You can find a more comprehensive ==example in [Writing your first Selenium script](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/first_script/)==

See the [Overview](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/overview/) to check the different project components and decide if Selenium is the right tool for you.

==You should continue on to [Getting Started](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/)== to understand how you can install Selenium and successfully use it as a test automation tool, and scaling simple tests like this to run in large, distributed environments on multiple browsers, on several different operating systems.

##### Selenium Overview

Is Selenium for you? See an overview of the different project components.

##### WebDriver

WebDriver drives a browser natively; learn more about it.

##### Selenium Manager (Beta)

==Selenium Manager is a command-line tool implemented in Rust that provides automated driver and browser management for Selenium==. Selenium bindings use this tool by default, so you do not need to download it or add anything to your code or do anything else to use it.

##### Grid

Want to run tests in parallel across multiple machines? Then, Grid is for you.

##### IE Driver Server

The Internet Explorer Driver is a standalone server that implements the WebDriver specification.

##### Selenium IDE

The Selenium IDE is a browser extension that records and plays back a user’s actions.

##### Test Practices

Some guidelines and recommendations on testing from the Selenium project.

##### Legacy

Documentation related to the legacy components of Selenium. Meant to be kept purely for historical reasons and not as a incentive to use deprecated components.
