## Best practices for resolving ComAgent issues

A clean and tidy computer is the key requirement for avoiding problems with ComAgent. This means running a scan for malware, cleaning your hard drive using [1 cleanmgr](https://www.file.net/info/command.html?q=cleanmgr) and [2 sfc /scannow](https://www.file.net/info/command.html?q=sfc%20%2Fscannow), [3 uninstalling programs](https://www.file.net/info/uninstall.html?q=unnecessary%20programs) that you no longer need, checking for Autostart programs (using [4 msconfig](https://www.file.net/info/command.html?q=msconfig) ) and enabling Windows' [5 Automatic Update](https://www.file.net/info/command.html?q=wuauclt%20%2FShowWindowsUpdate). Always remember to perform periodic backups, or at least to set restore points.

Should you experience an actual problem, try to recall the last thing you did, or the last thing you installed before the problem appeared for the first time. Use the [6 resmon](https://www.file.net/info/command.html?q=resmon) command to identify the processes that are causing your problem. Even for serious problems, rather than reinstalling Windows, you are better off repairing of your installation or, for Windows 8 and later versions, executing the [7 DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth](https://www.file.net/info/command.html?q=DISM.exe%20%2FOnline%20%2FCleanup-image%20%2FRestorehealth) command. This allows you to repair the operating system without losing data.

To help you analyze the ComAgent.exe process on your computer, the following programs have proven to be helpful: [A Security Task Manager](https://www.neuber.com/taskmanager/index.html?ref=file.net) displays all running Windows tasks, including embedded hidden processes, such as keyboard and browser monitoring or Autostart entries. A unique security risk rating indicates the likelihood of the process being potential spyware, malware or a Trojan. [B Malwarebytes Anti-Malware](https://www.file.net/tools/remove-virus.html) detects and removes sleeping spyware, adware, Trojans, keyloggers, malware and trackers from your hard drive.
